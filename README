TSE TMP FIX v1.0 - Copyright (c) 1999 by Antoni Sawicki
=======================================================

Abstract
========

Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server Edition has a serious reliability issue
associated with how TEMP folder is handled in multi user sessions.

By default TEMP folder has following structure:

c:\TEMP\xx

Where xx is a dynamicallly assigned user session number. Each user,
or even multiple logins of the same user id will have different session
numbers assigned in TEMP folder.

Generaly this approach would be viable, if not the fact that quite
often, during logoff procedure the system is unable to completely
delete the folder. You can often see large amount of session specific
temp subfolders left over in c:\TEMP directory.

These abandoned temp folders pose a serious security and stability risk.
For example if a user logs in and he or she gets assigned session id 42
and c:\TEMP\42 already exists, the new user will run in to problems
trying to access someone elses temporary files and folders. Quite often
resulting in access denied or other errors. Microsoft Office applications
are particularlly prone to temporary folder errors.

Terminal Server Edition has been demend quite unstable and unreliable for
these kinds of errors. It's believed that the TEMP folder is the main 
contributing factor.

This application implements a very simple work around by redirecting the
TEMP folder to reside under user profile directory instead. For example:

c:\wtsrv\profiles\johndoe\TEMP\47

This way, even if the TEMP\47 will not be deleted by the particular user
upon log off, at least he or she will have access credentials to manage
the files inside and not get constant Access Denied messages.


Usage Instructions
==================

1. Copy tsetmpfix.exe to c:\wtsrv\system32 directory.
2. Edit UsrLogon.cmd file and add tsetmpfix in begining of the script.
3. Let users log in and get the folders redirected to a new location.
